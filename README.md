# Word Sense Embeddings

The task is to implement Sense Embeddings for Word and Relational Similarity. I implemented a CBOW model using word2vec.

## Results
Spearman's correlation = 0.52

## Compatibility

Python3.X,&nbsp;&nbsp;Gensim

## Notes

In this project, two datasets were merged for training: EuroSense from http://lcl.uniroma1.it/eurosense/ And Semantically Enriched Wikipedia from http://lcl.uniroma1.it/sew/ . &nbsp;&nbsp;

This dataset was used for testing: WordSimilarity-353 from http://www.cs.technion.ac.il/~gabr/resources/data/wordsim353/ .
